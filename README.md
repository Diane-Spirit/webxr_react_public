# Diane UI - Teleoperation VR Interface

This is the UI for the Diane project, a teleoperation interface based on React and WebXR designed primarily for use with VR headsets.

## Features

- **Robot Selection**: You can select the robot to teleoperate from the list of available ones
- **Point Cloud Reception**: Once a robot is selected, you will receive real-time point clouds
- **VR Control**: Use VR controllers to move the robot in reality
- **WebXR Interface**: VR website optimized for virtual reality headsets

## Installation

To install the client, clone the repository and install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

You can start the application in two ways:

### Method 1: Development with Vite
